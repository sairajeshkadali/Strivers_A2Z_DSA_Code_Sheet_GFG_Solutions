Welcome to my personal collection of Data Structures and Algorithms solutions! This repository contains my completed solutions for every problem listed on the renowned **Striver's A2Z DSA Sheet**, with all problems sourced from the **GeeksforGeeks (GFG)** platform.

This repo serves as a living document of my progress and problem-solving journey. It's intended to be a helpful resource for fellow students preparing for technical interviews, recruiters looking to see my coding style, or anyone interested in different approaches to common DSA problems.

##  Key Features

* **Comprehensive Coverage:** Aims to include solutions for all problems on the A2Z DSA Sheet.
* **GFG Focused:** All solutions are implemented and verified on the GeeksforGeeks platform.
* **Fully Automated:** The repository is updated automatically the moment I solve a problem.

##  Automated Workflow

This repository's most unique feature is its **automation**. I use a Chrome Extension called [GFG to GitHub](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/gfg-to-github/cabcimjmdgiamcknfbmbifjgnpkfblnk) (or a similar tool).

Hereâ€™s how it works:
1.  I solve a DSA problem on the GeeksforGeeks platform.
2.  Upon a successful submission...
3.  The extension automatically commits and pushes my solution directly to this repository.

This hands-free process ensures that the repo is always a real-time reflection of my progress and completed work without any manual intervention.

##  How to Use This Repo

You can use this repository in several ways:

* **To Track My Progress:** This repo serves as a portfolio piece, demonstrating my dedication and consistency in practicing DSA.
* **To Compare Approaches:** See how my solution compares to your own.
* **As a Reference:** If you're stuck on a problem, you can look at my solution for inspiration or to understand a different perspective.

I encourage you to try and solve the problems yourself first, but feel free to use this as a learning aid when needed!
